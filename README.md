## drum-machine
Collaborative music creator that gives multiple users the power to create a drum beat in real time without being in the same room. 

## Motivation
This project was inspired by my desire to make music with my friends while living in different states. Allowing multiple people to edit a drum beat at the same time adds a creative dimension and can allow for new ideas to come into play.
